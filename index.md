# WELCOME TO WORKSHOP ON BIG DATA ANALYTICS IN AEROSPACE DOMAIN

## Exploring the Wonders of Science

Data analysis is essential task in aviation industry. As a result, big data analytics has unlimited scope in aviation sector. A plethora of sensors are an integral part for an aircraft which are used to collect different data like altitude, route distance, stability, weather etc. In general, big data in aviation sector contains data of high volume, high velocity, unstructured, and data from multiple sources in different forms. The aviation industry also use Internet of Things (IoT) to collect humongous amounts of data. All these combinations of large volume of data adds several challenges to make efficient decision in real-time. Challenges include the capture of data, storage, sharing, analyze, and view. This type of data requires new forms of analysis using artificial intelligence for optimization, decision-making, and knowledge discovery.

 

The motivation of organizing this workshop is to integrate the ideas of big data analytics in aerospace domain using machine learning methods and data-driven optimization. The researchers in aviation industry always try to adopt new tools, techniques, and technologies and as a result big data based analysis is a field of attraction for the improvement of overall performance across a range of different operations. Big data is becoming popular due to the continuous developments of high-speed computer. The data is increasing rapidly everyday so handling this much data becomes more and more difficult.
